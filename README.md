# ClassyBotMaker
---
---
ClassyBotMaker is an advanced AI-powered Minecraft bot system designed to automate a wide variety of tasks in the Minecraft world. The system is built around a hive-mind concept, with bots assigned specific roles like **miner**, **builder**, **explorer**, **lumberjack**, **farmer**, **combat**, **transport**, **crafting**, **assistant**, and **queen**. These bots use sophisticated decision-making processes powered by **Q-learning** and **TensorFlow**, allowing them to adapt and optimize their actions over time.

---
## Project Purpose

The purpose of ClassyBotMaker is to create a sophisticated system of intelligent Minecraft bots that autonomously perform various tasks, including resource gathering, structure building, exploring new areas, combat, and maintaining the hive. The primary goal is to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks in Minecraft, freeing up time for users to focus on higher-level strategy, creativity, or exploration within the game. These bots operate under a hive mind, where the Queen Bot oversees operations, assigns tasks, and ensures that all roles in the hive function harmoniously to achieve collective goals.

Whether you're a casual player looking to automate farming and mining or a more advanced player wanting to build complex fractal structures or manage large resource systems, ClassyBotMaker makes it possible to offload routine work to a fully automated and intelligent bot workforce. The project also serves as a platform for experimenting with AI-driven bots in a sandbox environment like Minecraft.

## AI Capabilities

- **AI Capabilities**
ClassyBotMaker bots are powered by a combination of Q-learning and TensorFlow models, which provide them with adaptive and intelligent decision-making capabilities. The AI allows bots to:

- **Adapt**
Each bot can learn from its actions and the outcomes of its tasks. For example, a mining bot learns to identify more efficient paths to minerals or better mining techniques, while a combat bot improves its strategies against hostile mobs. Over time, bots adapt to the environment and improve their task performance based on feedback and outcomes, constantly optimizing their behavior for better efficiency.

- **Optimize**
By refining their decision-making processes, the bots are able to execute tasks more effectively and in less time. They optimize resource gathering by determining the best tools to use, the most efficient routes, and even collaborative strategies with other bots for faster operations. Bots learn which methods yield the most effective results and continually improve themselves to become faster, more accurate, and resource-efficient.

- **Communicate**
Bots communicate vital information with each other and with the Queen Bot, which acts as the coordinator of the entire hive. Communication allows for real-time updates on tasks, resource availability, and environmental conditions. For instance, an explorer bot can inform the hive of new resources or dangerous areas, while the Queen Bot reallocates workers based on these updates. This collaborative effort ensures that the hive operates smoothly and adjusts dynamically to new conditions or threats.

## Console Program Overview

The ClassyBotMaker console program is the central control hub for managing the hive of bots. It provides a user-friendly interface to monitor bot activities, manage file dependencies, assign tasks, and even interact with advanced AI systems to enhance bot behavior. It offers a wide range of functionalities to ensure that the hive operates at peak efficiency:

-**Task Assignment and Management**
The console program dynamically assigns tasks to bots based on the current needs of the hive. The Queen Bot, through the console, ensures that tasks such as mining, crafting, farming, and exploring are properly distributed to the most suitable bots. This allows for optimal use of resources and ensures that critical tasks are completed on time. If the hive requires more resources, the Queen Bot might prioritize miners or lumberjacks, while reducing the focus on builders until enough materials have been collected.

-**File Backup and Dependency Management**
The File Backup feature ensures that important configuration files, bot scripts, and relevant data are safely backed up before any major changes. This preserves the integrity of the system and allows users to restore files in case of any issues. The Dependency Management feature simplifies the installation and updating of all required libraries and tools, ensuring the system remains up to date. This includes crucial dependencies for Minecraft, TensorFlow, and other relevant AI libraries.

-**AI Integration and Learning**
One of the most powerful aspects of the console program is its AI integration. Through the console, users can interact with OpenAI-powered models to process tasks and provide updates to bot behaviors. Users can send tasks to the AI for analysis and improvement, enabling bots to receive sophisticated updates based on feedback from tasks. This continuous AI-driven evolution allows bots to optimize their tasks and improve their decision-making capabilities. Additionally, bots can learn from how players perform tasks, observing human strategies and incorporating them into their behavior.

-**To-Do List and Task Processing**
The To-do List feature allows users to manage tasks that the hive needs to accomplish. Tasks can include gathering resources, building structures, or improving mining techniques. Users can send specific tasks to the AI for optimization, where the AI will analyze the task and suggest improvements. This ensures that tasks are not only completed but continuously improved upon, making the hive more efficient over time.---

## Dashboard Overview

The **Dashboard** allows users to monitor and control bots visually. It includes:
- **Live Bot Metrics**: View stats like resources gathered, blocks placed, or distance traveled.
- **Bot Perspectives**: Switch between different bot views to observe their tasks in real-time.
- **Task Control**: Start, stop, or modify bot tasks directly from the dashboard.
- **AI Decision Output**: Monitor how the AI processes decisions and how bots improve through Q-learning.
